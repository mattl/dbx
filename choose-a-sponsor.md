<h2>Sponsors</h2>

In the Dreadball Xtreme you will take on the role of a Sponsor, the organiser of the team.

Each of these is an individual who is looking to get wealthth and power through exploiting those desperate or unhinged enough to play in this most savage of sport, paying them to risk their lives in the arena. Each Sponsor has a budget of credits to hire these dregs and they choose to balance the quality of elite players against the quantity of no talent grunts they can put onto the pitch in search of that illusive win.

Different Sponsors have natural preferences and allegiances and so while they are free to hire whoever they want, the costs of players vary depending upon who is buying them.
