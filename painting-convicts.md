<h2>Paint a DreadBall Xtreme Convicts Team</h2>
<strong>By Peter Harrison from Talk Wargaming</strong>

Don your orange jumpsuit and check that explosive collar is still just that bit too tight because in this tutorial I will be showing you how to paint the convicts from Dreadball Xtreme.

Making use of the Army Painters war paints we have a step by step guide for achieving a look similar to those painted by the Mantic studio. In addition to the written guide we have also created a video that takes you through the steps from basecoat to finished miniature.
