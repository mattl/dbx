REQUIRES TEXT WRITING

Sponsors pick their “teams” for Xtreme from a pool of human and alien scum, according to their budget and preferences – for example, Warden Rasulov will pay less for convicts than Blaine.

Below is a sample of the players this sponsor prefers to field in their team, and therefore get to purchase at cheaper rates. Note that a Sponsor’s team is by no means limited to the players on show – you can pick from the entire pool of players available in the game, allowing you to truly build and customise your own team.

<h2>Asterian Kalyshi</h2>
