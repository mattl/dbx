REQUIRES TEXT WRITING

Sponsors pick their “teams” for Xtreme from a pool of human and alien scum, according to their budget and preferences – for example, Warden Rasulov will pay less for convicts than Blaine.

Below is a sample of the players this sponsor prefers to field in their team, and therefore get to purchase at cheaper rates. Note that a Sponsor’s team is by no means limited to the players on show – you can pick from the entire pool of players available in the game, allowing you to truly build and customise your own team.

<h2>Convicts</h2>

<!-- for each faction -->

The prison planets of the GCP area never ending pool of desperate and dangerous individuals who, with no future or hope of release, are willing to risk everything in the unlicensed arenas. With such easy access to these scum it is easy for unscrupulous wardens to recruit their teams from amongst them- and there is always the high explosive blast-collars that they wear to keep them in line (and maybe take out opponents with a well-timed detonation!)

<h2>Free Agents</h2>

As well as the two different teams, there is a wide range of crazy aliens, vicious mercenaries and assorted scum that a Sponsor can hire to help them win the game, each with their own individual skill and strengths.
