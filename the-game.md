DreadBall Xtreme is a tabletop board game for two players and the Galaxy’s most brutal sport. Two teams clash over a makeshift play area, seeking as much to wipe each other out as to score points! Pick a Sponsor, assemble your team of desperadoes, and unleash them on each other to see who will be the last one standing! 

The best way to begin playing Dreadball Xtreme is to get yourself a copy of the awesome, fun boxed game.
It contains everything that you will need to start playing:

<h2>Choose your sponsor and assemble your team!</h2>

Assume the role of sponsor and assemble your team from convicted felons, alien psychopaths or bloodthirsty mercenaries. The game contains two complete teams of Convicts and Asterians, including characterful prone figures. There is also a bizarre assortment of free agents for you to include in your team, such as the robotic training drones and bloodsucking aliens!

Every model comes match-ready and can be used straight out of the box – no assembly required!
