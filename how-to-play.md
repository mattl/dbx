<h2>How to Paint</h2>

You don’t need to paint your models in order to play and enjoy Deadball Xtreme, these beautifully sculpted Mantic miniatures are just perfect as they are.

However, painting your models is not only a way to make your teams look even more fantastic and unique to you, it is also a really fun and satisfying extra part of the hobby. By spending a bit of time you will be able to get some really impressive results that you can be proud of.

You can spend as much time as you wish in painting your models (indeed, for some people this is the thing they most enjoy and the game is just something to do with their beautiful collections.), however by following a few simple stages you can get really great results….
